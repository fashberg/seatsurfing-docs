# Confluence

You can integrate the web booking interface for your employees into [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence). This could be beneficially if you're already using Confluence in your organisation for collaboration. As organising common spaces for real-life collaboration is an essential part of this, Seatsurfing is also available as a Confluence App.

Using the Confluence App requires the Seatsurfing backend to be up and running. It's not a replacement for it, but an additional frontend.
