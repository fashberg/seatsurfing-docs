# Kubernetes

## 1. System Requirements
To set up the Seatsurfing backend on Kubernetes, the following system requirements must be met:

* Linux server(s)
* Kubernetes cluster with at least one worker node (tested with Kubernetes 1.22 and containerd version 1.5.x)
* Persistent storage for Postgres database (tested with Longhorn 1.2.x)
* Recommended: Reverse proxy with TLS termination (tested with nginx in front of Kubernetes' Traefik ingress)

## 2. Create database secret
Create a secret for your database password using ```kubectl```:

```
kubectl create secret generic seatsurfing-db \
  --from-literal=db-password='DB_PASSWORD'
```

Make sure to replace ```DB_PASSWORD``` with a secure password.

## 3. Create database deployment
Next, we'll create the necessary configurations and deployment for the Postgres database. This configuration contains:

* A persistent volume claim which contains the database files (adjust as needed)
* A deployment of Postgres version 13, inluding some adjustments to make sure Postgres runs well on Kubernetes
* A service which exposes TCP port 5432 of our Postgres database server
* A network policy which ensures that only our Seatsurfing backend is able to connect to the Postgres database service

Create a file ```seatsurfing-db.yaml``` with the following contents (modify as needed):

```

apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: seatsurfing-db
spec:
  storageClassName: longhorn

      initContainers:
      - image: alpine:latest
        name: init
        command: ["sh", "-c", "chown 999:999 /var/lib/postgresql/data"]
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
          name: db
          readOnly: false
          subPath: postgres

        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: seatsurfing-db
              key: db-password
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          value: "seatsurfing"
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: "seatsurfing"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"

```

Apply the file:

```
kubectl apply -f seatsurfing-db.yaml
```

## 4. Create Seatsurfing deployment and ingress
Now we're ready to create the configurations and the deployment of our actual Seatsurfing backend. This includes:

* A deployment of the Seatsurfing backend itself, which connects to the previously deployed Postgres database server
* A service which exposes port 80 of the Seatsurfing backend
* An ingress which makes the Seatsurfing backend available at host ```seatsurfing.your-domain.com``` (you'll need to change that) using Traefik

Please note: We're making the backend available insecurely via HTTP here. This example assumes you're having a reverse proxy performing TLS termination in front of your Kubernetes cluster. If this is not the case, you should really consider changing port 80 to 443 and add HTTPS encryption to the example.

Create a file ```seatsurfing-backend.yaml``` with the following contents (modify as needed):

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: seatsurfing-backend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: seatsurfing-backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: seatsurfing-backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: seatsurfing/backend:latest
        name: server
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - name: port-http
          containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_PASS
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: seatsurfing-db
              key: db-password
        - name: POSTGRES_URL
          value: "postgres://seatsurfing:$(POSTGRES_PASS)@seatsurfing-db/seatsurfing?sslmode=disable"
        - name: JWT_SIGNING_KEY
          value: "a_random_key"
        - name: PUBLIC_URL
          value: "https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com" 
        - name: FRONTEND_URL
          value: "https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: seatsurfing-backend
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: seatsurfing-backend
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: seatsurfing-backend
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
  routes:
  - match: Host(`seatsurfing.your-domain.com`)
    kind: Rule
    services:
    - name: seatsurfing-backend
      port: 80
```

Apply the file:

```
kubectl apply -f seatsurfing-backend.yaml
```

Make sure ```seatsurfing-db``` and ```seatsurfing-backend```and "Running":

```
kubectl get pods | grep seatsurfing
```

Afterwards, Seatsurfing can be accessed at the specified host (i.e. https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com).

## 3. Initial configration
Access the administrator web-interface using a modern web browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) at: /admin/

By default, an organisation with one administrator account is created on backend startup if no organisation already exists in the specified database. If not defined otherwise, use ```admin@seatsurfing.local``` as the username and ```12345678``` as the password.

The administrator interface can be used to manage room plans, users and settings. Read more about it in the [Administration](admin-ui.md) section.

## 4. Getting the mobile app
